### **Agile Methodology**

For planning the development and implementation of the Marisol website, a project kanban board was used as an Agile Tool through Github. This project board utilised issues as 'User Stories', a link can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Julia-cloudname/projects/8).

To help define the functionalities and prioritise key features, these 'User Stories' were broken down into 4 categories of importance; 'Must Have', 'Should Have',  'Could Have' and 'Won't have'.

'Must Have' represents a feature or functionality that is essential to the site, 'Should Have' is a defined requirement needed for the site, 'Could Have' is determined to be optional and 'Won't have' - future functionality that I'm going to do later.
