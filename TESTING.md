## **Bugs and Issues**

During testing, I encountered a TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__ error in the product_detail view of Django application. This error was triggered when attempting to display the rating of a product as a formatted string. The issue arose because the product.rating could be None if there were no reviews for the product, and the code attempted to format this None value using string formatting, which is not supported for NoneType.

Resolution

To address this issue, the product_detail view was updated with a conditional check that verifies if product.rating is None. If it is not None, the rating is formatted as a floating-point number with one decimal place. If it is None, indicating that there are no reviews and therefore no rating, a default string "No rating" is assigned. This approach ensures that the application can gracefully handle products without reviews without encountering a TypeError.
